GigPress provides an easy way for bands to list and manage their concerts and tours on their WordPress-powered website.

== Description ==

**GigPress is a WordPress plugin built specifically for touring bands.** As a website developer who was often building websites for independent bands -- and always using WordPress as CMS of choice -- I was constantly frustrated by the lack of a simple, viable method of incorporating live shows and tours into these websites. So I decided to brush up on my PHP and build my own.

###Features###

GigPress incorporates all the common requests you might have for a plugin of its ilk, including:

* Ability to list both upcoming shows and past shows, chronologically rolled-over as tour dates pass
* Grouping of shows into nameable tours
* hCalendar-rigged
* Auto-linking to Google Maps for venues with a street address
* Fields for venue and ticket-buy URLs, age restrictions, ticket price, and notes
* Built-in functions to display upcoming shows, past shows, and a sidebar listing
* Widget support
* Outputs XHTML-compliant, semantic markup

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `gigpress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your web server
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
3. To list upcoming shows, simply create a new page and put `[gigpress_upcoming]` in the page content.
4. To list past shows, create a new page and put `[gigpress_archive]` in the page content.
5. To use the GigPress sidebar widget, simply drag it into the widget area while on your Widget configuration screen. Options for the GigPress widget are set on the main GigPress Options page.
6. For detailed instructions, including using template tags in your theme templates, see the documentation: <http://gigpress.com/docs>
